**## StepUp_module_12to450V**

This repository contains a reverse‑engineered KiCad schematic and PCB layout from a commercial module originally purchased from AliExpress.

## Project overview
This project documents the electrical design and PCB layout of a third‑party module by recreating them from scratch in KiCad for learning, repair, and interoperability purposes.
The repository does not include any original vendor design files, firmware, branding, or trademarks.

## Origin and scope
Original hardware: Generic module purchased from AliExpress (exact vendor and listing may change over time, but such modules can be found using a subset of the following terms: "70W DC-DC 12V 24V To 200V-450V Voltage Adjustable Boost Power Converter Nixie Clock Tube Amplifier Capacitor Charging").
Status: Unofficial, reverse‑engineered reference design; not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by the original manufacturer or seller.
Contents: KiCad schematic, PCB layout, netlists, and supporting documentation created from measurements and inspection of a physical unit.

## Intended use
This repository is intended for:
* Educational use and study of the circuit and layout.
* Repair, modification, or replacement of compatible hardware.
* Integration into hobby or research projects, subject to any third‑party IP that may apply in your jurisdiction.
